## Project 2 Supplement - 8: Java Time Functions

Objective:

Learn to use Java's java.time package by creating three functions related to dates and times.

Returns the number of days between two dates.
Requirements:

Test-First: Write unit tests before implementing functions.
Git Workflow: Commit after each stepâ€”tests, function, and documentation.
Documentation: Provide clear code comments explaining the functions.
